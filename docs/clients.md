# Clients and interfaces

## Using the client library

The MCP server and the terminal both use `serial-nexus-client` rather than
speaking the socket themselves. The quickest path:

```rust
use serial_nexus_client::{Client, ClientConfig, ClientInfo, WaitSpec};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Starts serial-nexus-core if it is not already running, then says hello.
    let client = Client::connect(ClientConfig::new(ClientInfo::ai("my-agent")))?;

    // Live updates for a human-facing view.
    let events = client.subscribe();

    for device in client.list_devices()?.devices {
        println!("{} open={} baud={:?}", device.path, device.open, device.baud);
    }

    // Open and claim write control.
    let opened = client.open("/dev/ttyUSB0", Some(115_200), true)?;
    println!("role {:?}, control {:?}", opened.role, opened.control);

    // Recent history, then send exactly "version\r" and wait for one line.
    let history = client.read(opened.device_id, Some(20))?;
    let written = client.write_bytes(
        opened.device_id,
        b"version\r",
        Some(WaitSpec { lines: 1, timeout_ms: Some(2_000) }),
    )?;
    println!("{} lines, timed out: {}", written.lines.len(), written.timed_out);

    client.close(opened.device_id)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### API surface

| Call | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Client::connect(config)` | Connect, starting the core when needed. |
| `Client::connect_to_socket(path, info)` | Connect to a running core without auto-start (tests, embedding). |
| `hello()` | Core version, client id, socket and `Limits`. |
| `list_devices()` | `Vec<DeviceSummary>`: every detected device plus open devices (baud, client count, control holder). |
| `open(port, baud: Option<u32>, request_control)` | Open or join; returns `OpenResult { device_id, port, baud, role, control }`. |
| `close(device_id)` | Detach; the last client closes the device. |
| `read(device_id, lines: Option<usize>)` | `ReadResult { lines, dropped_lines, truncated }`; newest lines last; a partial tail is included and marked. |
| `write_bytes(device_id, bytes, wait: Option<WaitSpec>)` | Send exact bytes; optionally wait for post-write device lines. `WriteResult { bytes_written, lines, timed_out, truncated }`. |
| `status(device_id)` | `DeviceStatus` with control holder and history counts. |
| `subscribe()` | `Receiver<Event>`; each subscriber gets every future event. |
| `is_connected()` | False after the connection closes (a `TransportClosed` event is also sent). |
| `socket()` | The socket this client is using. |

`Event` variants cover raw device output, write echoes with source, client
join/leave, control granted/released/denied, device closed and core shutdown.
`DeviceOutput` and `Write` carry the original bytes (base64 on the wire),
decoded with `event.bytes()`.

Errors are `ClientError`. Use `error.code()` to match the core's `ErrorCode`
(`BaudConflict`, `ControlHeld`, `NotAttached`, `DeviceClosed`, `DeviceFailed`,
`NotFound`, `PermissionDenied`, ...); `is_control_held()` and
`is_device_gone()` cover the two common cases.

### Auto-start and packaging

`Client::connect` tries the socket first. If nothing answers and auto-start is
on, it starts `serial-nexus-core` detached (its own session, so Ctrl-C in the
client that launched it does not kill the shared core) and polls until the
socket accepts. The core locks its socket directory, so clients racing to start
it still end up with one core. `spawn_core()` returns the new process id.

The executable is found in this order:

1. `ClientConfig::core_binary` (an explicit path, for embedding);
2. `$SERIAL_NEXUS_CORE`;
3. the path compiled in with `SERIAL_NEXUS_CORE_DEFAULT` at build time (the
   Nix flake points this at its `serial-nexus-core` store path, so a client
   installed on its own still starts the core it was built against);
4. a `serial-nexus-core` next to the current executable (what `cargo build`
   gives);
5. `serial-nexus-core` on `PATH`.

A packaged client that keeps the core elsewhere sets either the explicit path
or `SERIAL_NEXUS_CORE` at runtime; `find_core_binary()` and `spawn_core()` are
public for wrappers with their own launch strategy.

### Human terminal

`serial-nexus-terminal` is the human client. It connects with `Client::connect`
(so a missing core is started automatically) as a human client and never takes
AI write control.

- The sidebar lists every device the core can see, with open/closed state, its
  active baud and the AI control holder. `Tab` switches between the sidebar
  and the stream.
- In the sidebar, `Enter` opens a closed device (after the baud prompt, default
  `115200`) or joins an open one at its active rate, `b` opens the baud prompt,
  `d` disconnects explicitly, and the arrow keys select. Opened devices stay
  attached while switching.
- In the stream, keys are written to the selected device as-is: arrows are ANSI
  sequences, Enter is CR and Backspace is DEL. Nothing typed is echoed locally;
  the device's own echo is still shown.
- Device output is rendered through a small ANSI screen (cursor movement,
  erase, SGR colours/attributes, OSC titles ignored). AI writes appear inline in
  a distinct colour, without labels; human writes are never added to the stream.
- The header shows the selected path, active baud, AI control holder and
  attachment; the footer shows errors, unplug notices and the baud prompt.
- `Ctrl+Q` (or `F10`) quits. Normal exit, I/O errors and panics restore raw
  mode and the alternate screen, and explicitly disconnect every device.
  Catchable termination signals (SIGTERM, SIGHUP) are not handled and may
  leave the terminal in raw mode; SIGKILL cannot be handled.

Tests drive the real client/core seam through PTY-backed simulated devices:
opening by prompt and joining, switching without reopening, no local echo,
device echo, visible AI writes, baud conflicts, unplug notices, explicit
disconnect and shutdown. State/input/render and the terminal cleanup guard are
tested without a real terminal.

### Core CLI

```
serial-nexus-core [--socket PATH] [--grace-secs N] [--control-idle-secs N]
                  [--history-lines N] [--default-baud N]
```

The same settings can come from `SERIAL_NEXUS_SOCKET`,
`SERIAL_NEXUS_GRACE_SECS`, `SERIAL_NEXUS_CONTROL_IDLE_SECS`,
`SERIAL_NEXUS_HISTORY_LINES` and `SERIAL_NEXUS_DEFAULT_BAUD`. Clients normally
never run it by hand.

## MCP server (`serial-nexus-mcp`)

`serial-nexus-mcp` is an MCP server over stdio: the AI host launches it and it
reaches the devices through `serial-nexus-client` and the core, starting the
core when needed. It never opens a serial port itself, so the core's rules (one
AI writer per device, baud conflicts, idle expiry, human writes) still apply.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serial": { "command": "/path/to/serial-nexus-mcp" }
  }
}
```

or, without installing anything, point the host at the flake (some hosts want
one command and no arguments):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serial": {
      "command": "nix",
      "args": ["run", "github:alvinla264/SerialNexus#serial-nexus-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After `nix profile install github:alvinla264/SerialNexus`, or `cargo install` of
the three crates, `"command": "serial-nexus-mcp"` works too. The core is started
by the first tool call; the host does not need to launch `serial-nexus-core`
itself.

Tools: `list_devices` (paths, open state, baud, control holder), `connect`
(`port`, optional `baud` and `request_control`; reports active baud and either
granted AI control or read-only with the holder), `disconnect`, `read` (recent
history lines labelled `device`/`ai`/`human`, partial lines marked, truncation
and drops reported) and `send` (exact text, no newline added; waits for the
requested device-output lines or a bounded timeout and returns what arrived,
including a marked partial line). One MCP session can connect to several
devices. There is no continuous stream: poll `read`.

See [`crates/serial-nexus-mcp/README.md`](../crates/serial-nexus-mcp/README.md)
for the tool reference, protocol notes and limitations (text only, one request at
a time per session, bounded waits and reads, Linux only).
